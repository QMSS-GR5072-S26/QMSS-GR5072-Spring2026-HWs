    "### My Data Search Journey\n",
    "As a student interested in **Econ and Policy**, I often find myself searching for reliable datasets for analysis. In the past, this process was *extremely frustrating*: I had to jump between dozens of government websites, deal with broken download links, and struggle with inconsistent data formats. This \"data-hunting\" process often took more time than the actual analysis itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I searched on the Github to see if there's project or package that can help me with, and here is one that I found really useful: https://github.com/davemachado/public-api. I chose this project because it is a **collective effort** to index thousands of free APIs, making it a \"one-stop shop\" for researchers like me."

    "The `public-apis` repository is essentially a curated list of APIs for various topics. Here are a few reasons why it is useful for my field:\n",
    "* **Efficiency**: It categorizes APIs into sections like *Finance, Government, and Environment*, saving me hours of searching.\n",
    "* **Real-time Data**: Unlike static CSV files, these APIs allow me to pull the *latest* market or policy updates directly into my code.\n",
    "* **Open Source**: The project is maintained by the community, ensuring the list stays updated and comprehensive.\n",
