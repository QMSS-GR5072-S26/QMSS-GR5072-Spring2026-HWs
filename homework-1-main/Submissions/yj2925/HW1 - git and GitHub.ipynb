    "As a student interested in **Economic trends and Market behavior**, I used to spend countless hours searching for clean, structured financial data. My experience was often a \"nightmare\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Fragmentation**: Market data is scattered across different platforms with inconsistent formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High Barrier to Entry**: Converting raw market data into something an AI model can understand requires complex preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"Headache\" of Integration**: I often got a headache trying to align timestamps from different economic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "I discovered **Microsoft Qlib** (https://github.com/microsoft/qlib?tab=readme-ov-file), which is an AI-oriented quantitative investment platform. It solves my problems by providing a full-stack infrastructure for data prep and model training."
