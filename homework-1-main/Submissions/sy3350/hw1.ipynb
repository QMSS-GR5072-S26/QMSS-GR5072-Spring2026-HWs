    "AI Basketball Analysis is an **AI-powered** basketball video analysis project that focuses on **object detection** and **pose estimation** to analyze shots and shooting form. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project highlights **object detection** and *human pose estimation* techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the app can do\n",
    "- Upload a basketball video/image for analysis (web app)\n",
    "- Send an image to a REST endpoint and receive JSON results (API)\n",
    "- Estimate shooting pose metrics using *OpenPose* (body keypoints like elbow/knee angles) \n"

    "1) detects relevant objects (e.g., ball/hoop) and shot outcomes,\n",
    "2) runs pose estimation with OpenPose to compute body keypoints,\n",
    "3) reports shot + pose results through the web UI and an API endpoint like `POST /detection_json`. \n"
